The main reason for suicide is said to be depression due to physical illness or failure in
examination, love or competition. A tendency of revenge is also said to be behind suicides.
According to this opinon some people commit suicide because of a burden of feeling guilty,
since they are unable to find a solution to get rid of guilty feelings. Many others commit suicide
because they are fed up of old age, rejection by spouse, unemployment, court cases, etc.
The reason for suicide is the experience of worthlessness of this life. It is also true that each
person-not just once but many times- thinks of his life as worthless and many times a burden.
To free himself from this burden, the person thinks of self destruction. The question arises, 'Is
life so much worthless that on account of disappointment in small matters, one should think
of ending it ?' If a self analysis is made seriously, it will be found that every person finds many
times that his life is worthless and burdensome.
Whatever the reason, but the worthlessness of life is felt with such intensity that by ending
it, no difference is felt. Life is like a river, which keeps on flowing from its source to its merger
into the sealife. It is a different thing that he does not develop enough courage to end his life. Even then
some impulsive individuals commit suicide because of petty reasons like failing in examination,
losing a job, quarrels in the family or defeat in a court of law. The number of people committing
suicide because of such reasons is on the increase.

people say that a man gets such a disappointing atmosphere everywhere around him that he
does not find any solution except this. According to some psychiatrists, people with violent
tendencies who are unable to express them, destroy themselves by these tendencies.

suicide because of such reasons is on the increase.
